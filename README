md5ish-password -- a simple password management system
====================================

## DESCRIPTION

A simple password management system.  Just pick a secret phrase ("i love popcorn", for example) and use it to generate a unique password for every domain you use.

md5ish-password can be used online with index.html and md5-min.js (copied from http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5).  For example, see: http://orifice.org/md5/.  I can also be used from the command line, see md5ish.sh.
